# The Cognitive Workflow: An Integrated Framework for Deep Research, Idea Generation, and AI-Augmented Creation

A comprehensive system that combines spaced repetition, motivation psychology, and digital knowledge management to create a powerful learning and research platform.

## 🧠 Overview

This implementation provides a complete system based on the cognitive science principles outlined in "The Cognitive Workflow" framework. It integrates three core components:

1. **Spaced Repetition System (SRS)** - For durable knowledge retention
2. **Motivation Engine** - For sustained engagement based on Self-Determination Theory
3. **Digital Second Brain** - For knowledge capture, processing, and synthesis

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

1. Clone or download the system files
2. Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed
3. Install required dependencies (if any)

### Running the System

```bash
# Start the interactive CLI
python cli_interface.py

# Or with custom data directory
python cli_interface.py --data-dir /path/to/your/data
```

## 📚 Core Components

### 1. Spaced Repetition System (SRS)

Based on the SM-2 algorithm, this system ensures optimal memory retention through scientifically-proven spaced repetition.

**Key Features:**
- SM-2 algorithm implementation
- Automatic interval calculation
- Progress tracking and analytics
- Card search and filtering

**Usage:**
```python
from srs_engine import SRSEngine, ReviewQuality

srs = SRSEngine()
card_id = srs.create_card("What is the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve?", 
                         "The exponential decay of memory over time", 
                         ["memory", "psychology"])
srs.review_card(card_id, ReviewQuality.GOOD)
```

### 2. Motivation Engine

Implements Self-Determination Theory principles to maintain long-term engagement.

**Key Features:**
- Quest-based learning system
- Achievement tracking
- SDT-based motivation scoring
- Habit formation support

**Usage:**
```python
from motivation_engine import MotivationEngine, QuestStatus

motivation = MotivationEngine()
quest_id = motivation.create_quest("Master Python", "Learn Python fundamentals", "programming")
motivation.start_quest(quest_id)
motivation.log_learning_session(quest_id, 45, 4, "Great progress!")
```

### 3. Digital Second Brain

Centralized knowledge repository with AI-augmented processing and synthesis.

**Key Features:**
- Content capture and processing
- Concept extraction and linking
- Knowledge graph construction
- Insight generation

**Usage:**
```python
from digital_brain import DigitalBrain, ContentType

brain = DigitalBrain()
content_id = brain.capture_content("Memory Research", "Content about memory...", ContentType.ARTICLE)
brain.process_content(content_id)
insights = brain.generate_insight(["memory", "learning"])
```

## 🔄 Integrated Workflow

The `CognitiveWorkflow` class orchestrates all three systems:

```python
from cognitive_workflow import CognitiveWorkflow

workflow = CognitiveWorkflow()

# Create a learning quest
quest_id = workflow.motivation.create_quest("Learn Cognitive Science", "Master memory and motivation", "learning")

# Capture and process content
content_id = workflow.capture_and_process_content(
    "Memory Research", "Content about memory...", ContentType.ARTICLE, quest_id
)

# Run daily review
results = workflow.daily_review_workflow()

# Get comprehensive dashboard
dashboard = workflow.get_workflow_dashboard()
```

## 📊 CLI Interface

The system includes a comprehensive command-line interface:

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Data Storage

The system uses JSON files for data persistence:
- `srs_data.json` - SRS cards and review history
- `motivation_data.json` - Quests, achievements, and sessions
- `digital_brain.json` - Content, concepts, and insights
- `sessions.json` - Workflow session history
