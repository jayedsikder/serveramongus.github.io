## 🚀 Usage Examples

### For Students
```python
# Create a learning quest
quest_id = workflow.motivation.create_quest(
    title="Master Python Programming",
    description="Learn Python fundamentals and build projects",
    category="programming"
)

# Capture lecture content
content_id = workflow.capture_and_process_content(
    title="Python Data Structures",
    content="Lecture notes about lists, dictionaries, and tuples...",
    content_type=ContentType.ARTICLE,
    quest_id=quest_id
)

# Review SRS cards
due_cards = workflow.srs.get_due_cards()
for card in due_cards:
    # Interactive review process
    workflow.srs.review_card(card.id, ReviewQuality.GOOD)
```

### For Researchers
```python
# Capture research papers
paper_id = workflow.capture_and_process_content(
    title="Memory Consolidation in Sleep",
    content="Research paper content...",
    content_type=ContentType.PAPER,
    tags=["memory", "sleep", "consolidation"]
)

# Generate insights
insights = workflow.generate_research_insights("memory consolidation")
```

### For Professionals
```python
# Start learning session
session_id = workflow.start_learning_session(quest_id)

# Log learning activity
workflow.end_learning_session(
    session_id, 
    quality_rating=4, 
    notes="Great progress on new concepts"
)

# View progress dashboard
dashboard = workflow.get_workflow_dashboard()
```
